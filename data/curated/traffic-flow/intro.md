This week we're exploring National Highways Traffic Flow data! National Highways operates and maintains motorways and major A roads in England. They directly monitor the speed and flow of roads using on road sensors, and the data can be accessed via the [National Highways API](https://webtris.nationalhighways.co.uk/api/swagger/ui/index).

This week's data has vehicle size and speed information for May 2021 from four different road sensors on the A64 road. 

* Do vehicles travel faster on certain days or at certain times?
* What time of day do large vehicles use this road?
* Do smaller vehicles travel faster?
